# Codenames

Codenames is a game that demands one player to give a word as a clue that relates to other two or three words on the board, and other players to guess the target words. This clue has to be THE word, an specific one that comprises the targets and excludes the bad words on the board. We propose an adapted model of [Divya Koyyalagunta et al.](https://github.com/divyakoyy/codenames.git) for that task, in Brazilian Portuguese.

All the Brazilian Portuguese data for the model, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wnsR50xsk3ANDSmv1KHN7H_FZlwFax_0).

Examples of model outputs can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1hAmRYGp_GfTr3QuZpiTiU9Gnu8rudCvw).
